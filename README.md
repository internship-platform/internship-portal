# AfroTal(Internship Portal)

## 📝 About

- One of the main concerns of African students is getting a job right after they graduate. This is because most of the companies in Africa are not aware of the skills that the students have. This project aims to solve this problem by creating a platform where students can showcase their skills and pair them with the right companies for internships. This will help students to gain experience and companies to find the right talent.
